        <h3>An Overview Of RoboCamps</h3>
        <p>
            At RoboCamps, students will learn and develop math, engineering,
            and computer science skills through a week-long robotics
            experience in which they work to design, build, and program a
            robot. The camp takes students through the VEX IQ challenge, a
            game-based engineering challenge, culminating in an interactive
            competition in which students put their creations to the test. In
            addition to developing classroom STEM concepts, students also
            learn lifelong skills in teamwork, leadership, and communication.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The camp will be held for students ages 8 to 14 (must be this age by
            the beginning of their session). Students will work in teams of two
            to build a robot to accomplish the specified challenge. Team 4099
            will have their students on site as camp counselors who will teach
            and assist the students.

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
            Team 4099 is a World Championship attending FIRST Robotics
            Competition (FRC) team based out of Poolesville High School. We
            apply our knowledge of Science, Technology, Engineering, and
            Math (STEM) to build a robot for a challenge given by the FIRST
            Robotics Competition. Students not only partake in the competition
            aspect of the team, but also focus on spreading STEM and robotics
            awareness in their communities. Team 4099 strives to create an
            inclusive learning community where students can learn and apply
            their knowledge in STEM to real-world problems.

        participate?</b></p>
        <p>A: Yes! Our camp is geared towards students of all ages and all
        experience levels. No previous robotics or coding experience is required.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What age groups are eligible for RoboCamps?</b></p>

        <p>A: The cost to attend one week of RoboCamps is $325. For each
        student you refer, you will receive a $20 discount if they also sign
        up. The price includes the cost of a camper shirt. If a camper signs up for more than one session per year, every session after the first sessions attended will have a 50% discount.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Is there a waitlist?</b></p>
        <p>A: Yes. You will automatically be placed on the waitlist if the session
        you have signed up for is full. We will email you if any spots open
        up.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Is there a deadline to register?</b></p>
        <p>A: Yes. You must register two days before the start date of your
        session. If there are not enough students registered by then, we will

        <p><b>Q: What is the cancellation policy?</b></p>
        <p>A: Full refunds will be offered until one week after your registration
        date. Half refunds will be offered until two weeks after. Refunds will only be offered if the camper has not attended the session at the time of request.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Do the students take the robots home?</b></p>
        <p>A: No, the kits that the students use to build the robots will be
        needed for the other sessions.</p>
        <p><b>Q: What is the difference between the Beginner and Advanced Sessions? Which one should I sign my camper up for?</b></p>
        <p>A: The Advanced Session will be of the same format, but will pose a much harder challenge and encourage more creativity on the camper's part. We will go deeper into concepts and teach more complex concepts as well.
            If your child has had robotics experience, we reccomend the Advanced Sessions. If you don't know which one to sign up for, feel free to send us an email.
