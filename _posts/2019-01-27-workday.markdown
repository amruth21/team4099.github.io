Programming worked on developing a procedure for tuning PID values, determining encoder conversions, and worked on communication with the driver dashboard. We also tried to test vision.  
Electrical worked on the board and made sure CAN worked. We also worked with the new compressor, PDP and  Neos/Spark Maxes.  
Fabrication worked to finish the intake for the robot by putting the hubs into the rollers and the bearings into the side of the shafts.  
Business continued to work on executive summaries and the video.
