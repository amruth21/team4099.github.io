Electrical worked with mechanical today and helped with building the hatch detaching mechanism. They also worked on pneumatics and trying to get the actuators to push the panel off.  
Programming continued to code grabber and climber subsystems, as well as the dashboard user interface. They also set up the Limelight for vision.  
Design worked on finishing the assembly for the drivetrain (adding gearboxes, sprockets, components on the bellypan) and researched designs for the 3 stage elevator and mecanum wheel intake.  
Business continued to work on the Showbest Fixtures grant and analyzed options for tshirts. Based on certain sponsorships, we might be able to get a better plan.  
Mechanical began prototyping different subsystems and started testing them against different metrics to optimize the efficiency of each subsystem.
