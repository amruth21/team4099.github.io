Electrical worked on the testing board. We troubleshooted the pneumatics system and worked with the roborio.  
Mechanical continued to prototype today. One challenge was figuring out compression and the variability of the size of cargo in the game.  
Programming continued to write subsytem code and work with the limelight.  
Design continued to work on the drivetrain assembly and the subsystems.  
Business continued to work on the Showbest Fixtures grant. We are in the process of putting finishing touches.
