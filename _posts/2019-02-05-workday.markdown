Mechanical continued to assemble drivetrain and started assembling cargo and hatch panel intakes. We ran into some clipping issues but worked with the Design team to fix it.  
Design adjusted the intake geometry and added limit switches to the elevator.  
Business continued to work on the Chairmanâ€™s Award video and essays.  
Programming got vision assisted aiming to work. We worked on calculating encoder values and using network tables to communicate between the driver dashboard and the robot.
