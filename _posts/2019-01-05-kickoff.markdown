Today was Kickoff! Everyone gathered together and watched the livestream to see what the theme and challenge would be for this year - Destination: Deep Space. In essence, we must be able to put hatch panels and cargo into a cargo ship and a rocket in minutes and 30 seconds. We did a game analysis and went through strategies to figure out the best approach to get the most points in the competition. Tomorrow, there will be a Design meeting to discuss designs for various parts of the robot.
