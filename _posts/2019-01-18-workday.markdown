Programming fixed code to get the pneumatic pistons finished, and helped electrical test the pistons with the hatch panel intake.  
Mechanical finished climber prototype and gripper (will test both tomorrow), and started testing hatch panel intake (wasnâ€™t successful).  
Electrical worked on finishing pneumatics and testing the manifolds. They also tested the hatch panel pistons and worked with motors.
