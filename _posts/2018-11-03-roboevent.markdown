Today was the very much anticipated RoboEvent for the Girl Scouts! The girls were fascinated by the robot we brought to the event. After we did a demonstration of the robot and told them about our team and what we do, we sent them off to make their own robot. They started with designing it and then programming it. There was a team member at each table to guide them through the process. By using Vex coding, they were able to program their robots to move through a course indicated by a gray line on the field. Every group was successful and all were given their Robotics badges.
