competition_summary: |
    is the game for the 2017 FIRST Robotics Competition. The game is played by two alliances of three teams each. Their robots compete on a field by delivering large plastic gears to an "airship" structure in the middle of the field. Additional points are scored by shooting wiffleball-sized "fuel" spheres into a goal. At the end of the match, robots earn a large number of points by climbing a team-supplied rope on the airship.

For the 2017 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Karl's Nightmare. We went to two district events, one in Bethesda and the other in Annapolis. We learned valuable lessons to help us in the upcoming season, while improving the on-field consistency of our robot compared to the previous season.
