competition_summary: |
    is the game for the 2017 FIRST Robotics Competition. The game is played by two alliances of three teams each. Their robots compete on a field by scoring wiffleballs which represent fuel into a simulated boiler which transfers the generated steam into an airship in the middle of the field. Each alliance has one airship, which they pressurize with steam from the boiler and load with plastic gears from the field. At the end of the match, robots can hang on team-supplied ropes attached to the airship for additional points.

For the 2017 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Karl's Nightmare. We went to two district events, one in Bethesda and the other in Annapolis. We learned valuable lessons to help us in the upcoming season, while improving the on-field consistency of our robot compared to the previous season.
