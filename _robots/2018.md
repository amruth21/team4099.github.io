competition_summary: |
    is the FIRST Robotics Competition game for the 2018 season. It involves two alliances of three teams each, with each team controlling a robot and performing specific tasks on a field to score points. The game has a retro 8-bit theme and teams are required to place milk crates, or "power cubes", on large balancing scales to tip the scale and gain ownership. Alliances can also trade power cubes for power ups, giving them a temporary advantage in a match. At the end of the match, robots can climb the tower attached to the centre balancing scale using a rung attached to the tower, giving them additional points.

For the 2018 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, The Chief. We went to two district events, one in Oxon Hill and the other in Edgewater. In our most successful season yet, we built a robot that worked to its fullest capacity in every match, with no reliability issues throughout both competitions. We reached the elimination round in both competitions and nearly advanced to the District Championships.
