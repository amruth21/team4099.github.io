# FRC Team 4099 Website

This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a tool that generates static webpages. This means that you get the performance advantages of a static website, but you get the convenience of using `includes` and `layouts` like PHP. 

## Getting Jekyll Set Up Locally

You can set up Jekyll to run on your computer, allowing you to make changes and see their effect before modifying the live page. In fact, **do not push any changes to GitHub before you verify that they work locally.** 

Jekyll setup instructions are available on their website for both [Windows](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) and [Linux/macOS](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). If you are using Windows, we recommend that you follow the RubyInstaller option - that is the one that has worked best for us so far.

## Getting Git Set Up Locally

Before you can push changes to the server, you'll need to make a GitHub account and have a team lead add you to the Team 4099 organization. 

### Git Terms
- repository/repo - a folder that contains files for a project. We try to use different repos for each project.
- local copy  / working copy - a version of a repository stored on your computer, as opposed to on GitHub servers
- `clone` - making a working copy of the repository. With GitHub, the main copy of the repository is saved on GitHub's servers. To modify it or to view it, you have to make a local copy and edit that.
- `add` or stage changes - making Git keep track of the changes you've made. If you make changes aand you don't stage them, they wil not be uploaded to the server. This can be useful (personal settings files that may be created), but can also be annoying to forget if you didn't stage files when you meant to.
- `commit` - store staged changes locally with a message. This logs whatever is staged and keeps track of it with a message. Make sure to commit often, because it is easier to keep track of what changed if commits do not contain a super long list of changes. Rules for how to write a good commit message are [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules).
- `push 

If you are unfamiliar with the command line, we recommend that you use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
