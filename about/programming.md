## Programming

The programming team is responsible for all software-related tasks the team has. This includes writing a scouting app, inventory software, robot code, and more.

During the offseason, the programming team refines robot software in preparation for offseason competitions. Additionally, they write any software that will be needed during the next build season, outside of the robot code.

During the build season, the programming team primarily focuses on writing robot code. This includes autonomous software, teleop software, computer vision, experimentation with scanning LIDAR, and more.
