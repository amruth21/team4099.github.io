## Electrical

The Electrical Team is responsible for all of the electrical wiring and pneumatics on the robot. This team works to ensure that all connections are solid throughout a full season, and that no matches will be missed due to a loose wire.

During the offseason, this group works on major projects with the mechanical and design teams to run wiring for offseason robots. Additionally, they may have different projects intended to figure out how to improve system reliability during the build season.

During the build season, the electrical team works on designing and creating an electrical board for the competition robot. The team creates the board in CAD, then after it is machined, assembles the board and runs wires and pneumatic tubes. They then test to ensure that there are no weak connections that may come loose during a competition. This subteam is also responsible for regular checks on the robot to ensure that competition wear has not degraded any electrical components.
