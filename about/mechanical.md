# Mechanical

The Mechanical Team is responsible for prototyping, fabrication, and assembly of any physical part that is needed by Team 4099. This includes prototyping mechanisms during the build season, constructing parts for offseason projects, assembling the final and practice robots, and more. 

During the offseason, the mechanical subteam works closely with the electrical and design subteams to create an offseason robot. They work with design on the CAD for the offseason robot, and then use machine tools to machine the parts.

During the build season, similarly, the mechanical team works with the design team to create a working CAD model of the competition robot. Then, they take the generated CAD model and fabricate and construct the robot.
